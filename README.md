# 📊 E‑Commerce Customer Behavior Analysis

## 📑 Project Overview
This project explores an **E‑Commerce Customer Behavior Dataset** with 5,000+ records and 18 features.  
The dataset captures customer demographics, purchase details, browsing behavior, payment preferences, delivery times, and satisfaction ratings.  
The goal is to perform **end‑to‑end exploratory data analysis (EDA)** — from cleaning and wrangling to visualization and insights — without machine learning.
