📊 E‑Commerce Customer Behavior Analysis
📑 Project Overview
This project analyzes an E‑Commerce Customer Behavior Dataset containing 5,000 records and 18 features. The dataset captures customer demographics, purchase details, browsing behavior, payment preferences, delivery times, and satisfaction ratings.

The goal is to perform end‑to‑end exploratory data analysis (EDA) — from cleaning and wrangling to visualization and insights — without machine learning. The project demonstrates how a data analyst can extract actionable business insights and present them in a clear, portfolio‑ready format.
